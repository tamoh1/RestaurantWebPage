					<P>About Us</P>
					<P>The Bank Cafe on South Mall was opened on the 1st April 2013 following the nationalization of Bank of Ireland.</P>
					<P>Much of the original interior of the bank has been retained so the Bank Cafe offers a unique contemporary dining experience.</P>
					<P>~ ~</P>
					<P>The restaurant is also a fully functioning bank. Your teller is able to process most common transactions at your table, however for cash transactions over 
					   EUR3000 customers should go to the cash desk located next to the baby changing facilities.</P>
